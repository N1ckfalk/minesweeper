This is the my first game in my life<br>

Current version - 3.10.4)

Whell, once you have downloaded python<br> 
Download the game code and run the file __minesweeper.py__

Second step
-
> Run the file **minesweeper.py**

Third step - you can play the game!

At the very beginning, you appear in the menu with a choice of mode difficulty

> Easy - Field 15x10 with 10 bomb<br> 

> Normal - Field 20x15 with 60 bomb<br> 

> Hard - Field 35x20 with 130 bomb<br> 

Before that, write your name and you can play this game<br>
